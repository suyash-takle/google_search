Project: Google Search Clone
This project is a front-end implementation of Google's search interface, created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of the main Google Search page, Image Search, and Advanced Search functionalities.

Features
The project consists of three main pages:

Google Search (index.html):

A clean, central search bar for general queries.

Includes two buttons: "Google Search" to see the results and "I'm Feeling Lucky" which redirects to the first result.

Links in the top-right corner to navigate to the Image and Advanced search pages.

Image Search (image_search.html):

A dedicated page for finding images.

Submitting a query on this page will take you directly to Google's image search results.

Includes a link to return to the main Google Search page.

Advanced Search (advanced_search.html):

Provides a more detailed search form, similar to Google's own advanced search page.

Users can filter results by:

All these words

This exact word or phrase

Any of these words

None of these words

Numbers ranging from...

The form is styled to be clear and easy to use.

Project Structure
The project is organized with the following files:

index.html: The main Google Search page.

image_search.html: The page for Google Image Search.

advanced_search.html: The page for Advanced Search options.

style.css: A single stylesheet that provides the styling for all three HTML pages, ensuring a consistent design.

static/: A directory containing image assets like the Google logo and favicon.

The design aims to be aesthetically pleasing and consistent with Google's own design language, using CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness.
